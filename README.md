# MPEG-21-Part-23 Smart Contract for Media DLT-Manager

This library allows the deployment and parsing of Smart Contract for Media into an EVM-compatible chain.

## Smart Contract for Media and Non Fungible Tokens

The Smart Contracts for Media can take advantage of Non Fungible Tokens to store Media Contractual Objects. In particular, each Smart Contract for Media generated by a MPEG-21 Contract can reference tokens already present in the DLT that refer to a specific Media Contractual Object instance.

We can devise two constituent parts of a Smart Contracts for Media:

- the immutable information that is included in the smart contract that refers to data stored on-chain (e.g., tokens ids) or off-chain (e.g., a hash of a datum);
- the immutable set of instructions that implements the logic of the contract, i.e., the functionalities.

In order to be immutable, data do not necessarily have to be stored directly on-chain. Indeed, this practice is costly in terms of time, space, and economic in most DLTs. Off-chain data storage, accompanied by on-chain storage of the result of the cryptographic hash function, is a tradeoff that allows for information immutability and more cost-effective processing.

Thus, a Media Contractual Object, e.g., a payment obligation, can be stored off-chain, and then its hash stored within a Non Fungible Token. Some functionalities can be created from the same Object, too, e.g., income shares and a Smart Contract for Media will include these together with the on-chain reference to the token.
Interoperability of data on-chain can be obtained using simple data links, i.e., smart contracts that reference other smart contracts’ addresses and tokens’ ids. For instance, an IP Entity can be represented by a single Non Fungible Token with an id equal to N issued in a contract with an address equal to X. Then, a Smart Contract for Media with address Y that includes that specific IP Entity in its clauses only needs to reference the address X and the id N. Another Smart Contract for Media with address Z that updates the previous one only needs to refer to the same token N in X without having to create a new one.
